        <div class="p-3"></div>
        <p>
          IT sourcing teams are expected to balance between controlling technology run costs and risks while simultaneously building strategic technology partnerships. They are required to create a wide range of win–win external partnerships to access state-of-the-art software and solutions—such as cloud, machine learning, and advanced analytics—acquire global talent, enable agile processes, and procure innovative services. This requires a fundamental shift in the sourcing strategy, execution approach, and capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We work with organizations to fully capture the potential of digital sourcing and deliver services in a scalable and cost-effective manner.

        <p>
          In addition to implementing tools that enhance transparency, we work with clients to integrate lean construction practices to improve labor and equipment productivity, generate significant cost and time savings, and improve loyalty and trust between project owners and contractors teams.

      We have established a global team of lean experts who work with clients in four primary ways:

        <h3>Lean diagnostic</h3>
        <p class="col-md-6">
          Through the use of qualitative and quantitative tools—data analyses and benchmarks, management interviews, field observations, and expert assessments—we pinpoint the project status and reveal project gaps and improvement opportunities.

        <h3>Last Planner System implementations</h3>
        <p class="col-md-6">We facilitate implementations to integrate lean principles into all aspects of projects. Our experts collaborate with the field teams to develop a feasible, coordinated master plan and rollout strategy. We also coach the project team to develop the skills needed to sustain the effort and facilitate future implementations.</p>

          Capability building
        </h3>
        <p class="col-md-6">
          We provide project teams, including contractors and subcontractors, 
          with targeted lean construction training modules and coaching to equip them with the right skills to ensure sustainability of lean efforts throughout execution. We provide lean boot camps, 
          3-day intensive trainings that use lean simulations to demonstrate the practical application of lean principles in design, construction, and commissioning. Composed of several modules, 
          the boot camp equips participants with the necessary knowledge and tools to deploy lean construction.

        <h3>Lean transformation</h3>
        <p class="col-md-6">
          From project-based to corporate-level transformation, we help to create lasting change in the culture of the organization by establishing a new mind-set and behaviors that support continuous improvement and respect for people, the two fundamental pillars of lean.
